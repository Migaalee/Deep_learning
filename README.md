# Deep_learning
Deep learning (Tensorflow and Keras). Python

In my Deep Learning repository, you'll find a mix of tutorials and hands-on notebooks where I dive into the world of neural networks and model building. One highlight is the ADNE tutorial, which I created using Google Colaboratory—perfect for anyone interested in applied deep learning. I’ve also included a series of notebooks titled DeepNeuralNetworks_Migla, where I break down the fundamentals and implementation of deep neural networks across multiple examples. Whether you’re exploring datasets like AutoMPG.tsv or running through deep learning models step-by-step, this repo is packed with resources for anyone eager to learn about deep learning
